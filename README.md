Right now this repository contains a CSV with a list of jobs run at NERSC during
2017 and a Jupyter notebook used to analyze these job data to determine what
should qualify as a "big job" given the 2017 workload.

This data and code is not licensed for distribution.  Don't distribute it.  You
should probably not even look at it.  Definitely don't publish and/or cite it.
